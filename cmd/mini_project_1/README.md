## Project Post Mortum

I had a lot of fun writing this. It may be because I like James Bond esque movies but the Go syntax is definetly something you can get used to.

The way looping through functions is done is a little odd not gonna lie but you get used to it. And I like how errors are handled! It makes it very easy to tell what function can throw an error in your code making it very easy to write code that has proper error handling! Its even easier to remember to handle the errors in your own functions since you pass them as arguements!

My perception of Go has improved!
